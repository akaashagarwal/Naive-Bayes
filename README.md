# Naive-Bayes-Scratch
The purpose of this project, as the heading suggests, is to implement the Naive Bayes Classifier in Python from scratch.
The focus here is not to maximise the prediction accuracy, but it is to translate the theoretical base of the Naive Bayes into code, therefore steps to visualize data and perform data exploration have been skipped. Missing values, however, have been imputed.

The data set used is one which contains information on a set of patients who are either diabetic or non-diabetic. The goal is to build a Naive Bayes classifier and make a prediction on whether a given patient is diabetic or not.

Finally, to test whether the implemented Naive Bayes algorithm is working as expected, the performance is compared with that of an in-built Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier found in the well-known machine learning library, sci-kit learn.
